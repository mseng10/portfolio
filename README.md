# My Portfolio Website

[![AWS S3 Deploy](https://github.com/mseng10/portfolio/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mseng10/portfolio/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository is home to my personal static portfolio website!

I've always wanted to build my own little corner on the web to showcase my projects and skills, and I figured it would be a really fun and rewarding experience to finally make it happen.
